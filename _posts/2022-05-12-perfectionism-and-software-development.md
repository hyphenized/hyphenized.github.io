### Why perfectionism is not a good approach for software development
I used to spend a lot of time focusing on the best possible solution, until I learnt that no matter how good your design/code/whatever-you-call-it is, with time, requirements change and with that, the code you dedicated hours to could end up being thrown away. Thus, I realized perfectionism would not give me an acceptable solution in a mindful amount of time.

That doesn't mean you should forget about attention to detail when designing a solution, just don't go overboard with it. As some people say: "done is better than perfect". 
### What about [purists?](https://automationpanda.com/2017/09/26/purist-vs-pragmatist/)?

I admire their work and I think it is with the same dedication they have that we often improve our skills.
