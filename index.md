# Hello! I am hyphenized, a full stack developer.

Currently working with Rails/Postgres/React/Typescript. :cool:

That includes deploying a containerized application from scratch, or using PaaS like heroku. I also know a bit about design principles and usability so you can count on me to give you feedback on your ux designs :).

I like functional programming more than OOP but I know that when it comes to the actual implementation there's no one-size-fits-all solution.

Some posts are short, some are not long. They might also change in the future. 

Finally, my opinions are my own but, if you spot a mistake feel free to send me an email :ratdance:
