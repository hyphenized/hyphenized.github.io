# Hello! I am hyphenized, a full stack developer.

Currently working with Rails/Postgres/React/Typescript. :cool:

That includes deploying a containerized application from scratch, or using PaaS like heroku. I also know a bit about design principles and usability so you can count on me to give you feedback on your ux designs :).

I like functional programming more than object oriented but I know that when it comes to the actual implementation there's no one-size-fits-all solution(or paradigm for that matter).

This blog's brand new, some posts are short, some are not long and some might change in the future.

Finally, my opinions are my own but, if you spot a mistake feel free to send me an email :ratdance:
